# MazeRunner: A Maze Solving Robot
The MazeRunner project is a robotics system designed to autonomously navigate a user defined maze using localisation, image processing, path planning, and motion control. The system captures an image of the maze, locates it in a global frame, processes it to extract relevant features, generates an optimal path, and executes precise movements using a robotic arm (UR3) mounted on a table.

## Project Overview
Maze Runner is a robotics project that aims to automate maze solving using a UR3 robotic arm. A camera captures an image of a maze, which is then processed to detect its structure. A path-planning algorithm determines the optimal route, and the UR3 traces the solution using a marker-holding end-effector. This project integrates computer vision, motion planning, and robotic control, making it a challenging and valuable exercise in autonomous system development.
